---

Dear SDKBox users:

    Many thanks to all our users around the world. Thank you for joining us in a long and wonderful journey.

    Since incubation, SDKBox has been dedicated to providing agile and powerful solutions to our customers on top of striving to offer our services completely free of charge. Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that this is no longer aligned to our current realities and goals.

    To our customers already integrated our services to existing project, please kindly take note that:
        * SDKBox is a plugin designed to better integrate third-party SDKs to your projects and does not alter the operations of said SDKs in any manner.
        * Removing SDKBox will not negatively affect any of the third-party SDKs in any fashion.
        * We recommend uninstalling SDKBox from your project at your convenience.
 
    Thank you again for choosing SDKBox and we wish to see you again soon in the future.

各位 SDKBox 使用者:

    你们好.
    很高兴能与位于世界各地的你们, 在移动游戏这一领域, 共同经历了这么长一段时间的奇妙时光.
    从 SDKBox 成立之初, 一直在免费与持续运营之间找寻平衡点. 很抱歉, 我们自己并没有找到. 现在是时候说再见了.

    那么对于已经集成 SDKBox 相关服务的 App , 以下这几点, 你需要知道:
        * SDKBox 本身是一套工具, 并不参与 SDK 本身功能的运行 .
        * SDKBox 服务的关掉, 并不会影响 App 中 SDK 本身功能的运行, 但是建议在下一次更新时, 去除掉 SDKBox .

    江湖路远 有缘再见
